# Foodie-Recipes-App

## Description
The Foodie App enables users to discover recipes based on ingredients, dietary preferences, and intolerances. If users have specific ingredient/s at their disposal, they can initiate a search and receive up to four recipes featuring that ingredient/s for inspiration.

Once the recipes are displayed, users also receive information about the calories of each ingredient, allowing them to assess the overall healthiness of the recipe.

The app utilizes Local Storage to save information about ingredients, intolerances, and dietary preferences previously searched by the user. This means that when the page is refreshed, the buttons associated with previous searches remain on the page for easy access.

The code uses two server-side food APIs: Spoonacular https://spoonacular.com/food-api and Edamam https://www.edamam.com/.

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

The code is deployed at https://rgc1.github.io/Foodie-Recipes-App/
